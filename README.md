# Predicting Efficacy of Antibiotics in Case of Gonorrhoea by Harnessing Machine Learning
# Introduction

Gonorrhoea is sexually transmitted infection caused by
“Neisseria gonorrhoea”.
symptoms include:-watery, creamy, or greenish vaginal
discharge. pain or burning while urinating. an urge to
urinate more frequently.
Rates of this infection are on rise across the globe so is
incidence of antibiotic resistance in this bacteria making
the treatment more challenging.
A prevalent sexually transmitted disease, poses a
significant global public health challenge.

# About Dataset
The dataset contains records about efficiacy of anti - biotics like Azithromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Cefixime, Tetracycline and Penicillin based on multiple features like Sample_ID, Year, Country, Continent, Beta.lactamase, Azithromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Cefixime, Tetracycline, Penicillin, NG_MAST, Group, azm_mic, cip_mic, cro_mic, cfx_mic, tet_mic, pen_mic, log2_azm_mic, log2_cip_mic, log2_cro_mic, log2_cfx_mic, log2_tet_mic, log2_pen_mic, azm_sr, cip_sr, cro_sr, cfx_sr, tet_sr and pen_sr. The dataset contains 89731 records (8 categorical and 23 continuous) 
Name: Metadata Gonorrhea
Number of instances: 89731

# Machine Learning Algorithm
The project employs the following machine learning algorithm
# Logistic Regression
The Logistic Classifier is a fundamental tool in supervised learning, specifically designed for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class, utilizing a logistic function. It is widely employed due to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability.
# Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest Classifier, belonging to the ensemble learning category, is a versatile tool suitable for both classification and regression tasks. It constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
# Decision Tree Classifier
The Decision Tree Classifier is a straightforward and interpretable supervised learning algorithm. It partitions the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure. Decision trees are advantageous for their ease of understanding and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.
